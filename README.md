Uber Eats Cloning Project
========================
A HTML & CSS Practice Project
------------------------

The Uber Eats cloning project was my first ever attempt at building a site with HTML and CSS. Also used Uber Move Text fonts to give the clone an authentic feel. 
This project helped me better understand the use of margins, paddings, flex and grid properties of CSS.
Pending work on this version includes the following:

- [ ] Input icons into input and select elements. A first attempt caused a misaligment with input, select and button elements.
- [ ] Input the scrolling navbar- Should be done after learning Javascript.
- [ ] Make site responsive to mobile and tablets.
